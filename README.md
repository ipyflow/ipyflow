TL;DR
-----
Reactive Python notebooks for Jupyter[Lab]:

1. `pip install ipyflow`
2. Pick `Python 3 (ipyflow)` from the kernel dropdown.
3. Use `ctrl+shift+enter` (or `cmd+shift+enter` on Mac) to execute a cell and
   everything that (recursively) depends on it:

About
-----
IPyflow is a next-generation Python kernel for Jupyter and other notebook
interfaces that tracks dataflow relationships between symbols and cells during
a given interactive session, thereby making it easier to reason about notebook
state. Here is a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZnDlyKk7g&t=8s)
of the JupyterCon talk introducing it (and corresponding
[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D9MSiIkwv7gjRr7jfNYZXki9TfkoUr4Yr-a06i0w_QU)).

If you'd like to skip the elevator pitch and skip straight to installation /
activation instructions jump to [quick start](#quick-start) below; otherwise,
keep reading to learn about IPyflow's features.

Features
--------
IPyflow ships with classic Jupyter + JupyterLab extensions that provide the
following user-facing features.

### Execution Suggestions

IPyflow understands exactly what data changed in your notebook, when it
changed, and when it got referenced. This allows it to provide *execution
suggestions* whenever running some upstream cell changes data that downstream
cells depend on. To keep the execution state consistent with the code in cells,
rerun the turquoise-highlighted cells, and avoid the red-highlighted cells:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipyflow/ipyflow/master/img/suggestions.gif" />
</p>

A turquoise-highlighted input with red-highlighted output just means that the
output may be out-of-sync.

### Reactivity

IPyflow enables opt-in reactive execution for both Jupyter and JupyterLab
(similar to [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) or
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), wherein execution of cell `C`
results in automatic re-execution of all of `C`'s dependents). Use
ctrl+shift+enter (on Mac, cmd+shift+enter also works) to execute a cell and all of the cells that
(recursively) depend on it reactively:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipyflow/ipyflow/master/img/reactive-hotkey.gif" />
</p>

You can also run the magic command `%flow mode reactive` in any cell to enable
reactivity as the default execution mode:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipyflow/ipyflow/master/img/reactivity.gif" />
</p>

Disable by running `%flow mode normal`.

If you'd like to make reactivity the default behavior (not recommended, unless
you do not mind being surprised occasionally), you can add this to your IPython
profile (default location typically at
`~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py`):

```python
c = get_config()
c.ipyflow.exec_mode = "reactive"
```

### Syntax Extensions

Prefixing a symbol with `$` in a load context will cause the referencing cell
to re-execute itself, whenever the aforementioned symbol is updated (regardless
of execution mode):

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipyflow/ipyflow/master/img/syntax-extensions-load.gif" />
</p>

You can also use the `$` syntax in store contexts, which triggers cells that
reference the corresponding symbol to re-execute, regardless of whether the
reference is similarly `$`-prefixed:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipyflow/ipyflow/master/img/syntax-extensions-store.gif" />
</p>

Finally, you can also prefix with `$$` to trigger a cascading reactive update
to all dependencies in the chain, recursively:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipyflow/ipyflow/master/img/syntax-extensions-cascading-store.gif" />
</p>

### Integration with ipywidgets

IPyflow's reactive execution engine, as well as its APIs (see "State API" below)
are fully compatible with `ipywidgets`, allowing cells to respond to slider changes,
button clicks, and other events:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipyflow/ipyflow/master/img/ipywidgets-integration.gif" />
</p>

This functionality can be paired with other extensions like
[stickyland](https://github.com/xiaohk/stickyland) to build fully reactive
dashboards on top of JupyterLab + IPyflow.

## State API

IPyflow must understand the underlying execution state at a deep level in
order to provide its features. It exposes an API for interacting with some of
this state, including a `code` function for obtaining the code necessary to
reconstruct some symbol:

```python
# Cell 1
from ipyflow import code

# Cell 2
x = 0

# Cell 3
y = x + 1

# Cell 4
code(y)

# Output:
"""
# Cell 2
x = 0

# Cell 3
y = x + 1
"""
```

You can also see the cell (1-indexed) and statement (0-indexed) of when a
symbol was last updated with the `timestamp` function:

```python
from ipyflow import timestamp
timestamp(y)
# Timestamp(cell_num=3, stmt_num=0)
```

To see dependencies and dependents of a particular symbol, use the `deps` and
`users` fuctions, respectively:

```python
from ipyflow import deps, users

deps(y)
# [<x>]

users(x)
# [<y>]
```

If you want to elevate a symbol to the representation used internally by
IPyflow, use the `lift` function (at your own risk, of course):

```python
from ipyflow import lift

y_sym = lift(y)
y_sym.timestamp
# Timestamp(cell_num=3, stmt_num=0)
```

Finally, IPyflow also comes with some rudimentary support for watchpoints:

```python
# Cell 1
from ipyflow import watchpoints

def watchpoint(obj, position, symbol_name):
    if obj <= 42:
        return
    cell, line = position
    print(f"{symbol_name} = {obj} exceeds 42 at {cell=}, {line=}")

# Cell 2
y = 14
watchpoints(y).add(watchpoint)

# Cell 3
y += 10

# Cell 4
y += 20
# y = 44 exceeds 42 at cell=4, line=1
```

Quick Start
-----------
To install, run:
```bash
pip install ipyflow
```

To run an IPyflow kernel in JupyterLab, select "Python 3 (ipyflow)" from the
list of available kernels in the Launcher tab. For classic Jupyter, similarly
select "Python 3 (ipyflow)" from the list of notebook types in the "New"
dropdown dialogue.

Similarly, you can switch to / from IPyflow from an existing notebook by
navigating to the "Change kernel" file menu item in either JupyterLab or
classic Jupyter:

Citing
------
IPyflow started its life under the name nbsafety, which provided the initial
suggestions and slicing functionality.

For the [execution suggestions](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p1093-macke.pdf):

}
```

For the [dynamic slicer](https://smacke.net/papers/nbslicer.pdf) (used for
reactivity and for the `code` function, for example):
```bibtex

  publisher={VLDB Endowment}
}
```

We don't have a paper written yet for the syntax extensions that implement the
reactive algebra, but in the mean time, you can cite the IPyflow repo
directly for that and anything else not covered by the previous publications:
```bibtex
@misc{ipyflow,
  title = {{IPyflow: A Next-Generation, Dataflow-Aware IPython Kernel}},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/ipyflow/ipyflow}},
  year = {2022},
}
```

Acknowledgements
----------------
IPyflow would not have been possible without the amazing academic collaborators
listed on the above papers. Its reactive execution features are inspired by
those of other excellent tools like [Hex](https://hex.tech/) notebooks,
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), and
[Observable](https://observablehq.com/). This work has benefited from the
support of folks from a number of companies -- both in the form of direct
financial contributions ([Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/),
[Hex](https://hex.tech/)) as well as indirect moral support and encouragement
([Ponder](https://ponder.io/), [Meta](https://www.meta.com/)). And of course,
IPyflow rests on the foundations built by the incredible Jupyter community.
